## Shoestring

Welcome! Shoestring is a (very) simple budget keeping app for your travels. To begin with you add your travel dates & budget, and while (or before) you're away add expenses.

Each day of your trip you'll see how you are tracking with your budget. If you are burning your budget at a faster rate than your trip duration then you'll see straight away from the handy charts.

## Technology used

This app is built using Sinatra & Javascript, and has a Postgres database.
